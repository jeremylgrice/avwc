So you want to grab data from somewhere with JavaScript, but arenâ€™t sure how to do it? Well look no further!

Today, I want to show you how to use the **Fetch API**, which is now built into JavaScript. Weâ€™ll cover:

- Setting up a React class component
- Managing state
- Performing a fetch to a live API
- Displaying results on a web page

---

### The API Weâ€™re Using

We'll use the [D&D 5e API](http://www.dnd5eapi.co/docs#intro), which is free and doesnâ€™t require an API key.

Weâ€™ll specifically use the `/api/classes` endpoint to fetch and display data in a list format.

### The React Component

Weâ€™re using a **class-based component** in this example. If you come from an object-oriented background, this will feel familiar. Here's a breakdown of whatâ€™s happening:

- **Constructor:** Used for setting the initial state and binding event handlers if needed.
- **componentDidMount():** A React lifecycle method invoked immediately after a component mounts. This is where we fetch data using `fetch()`.
- **State Management:** We update the state with either the API result or an error.
- **Render():** Displays the result on the page.

I like to extract logic into small functions that I can plug into the component where needed. This makes the code easier to maintain and improves readability.

### Want to Learn More?

If you want to dig deeper into the **Fetch API**, check out:

- [Using Fetch - MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
- [Axios (Alternative to Fetch)](https://axios-http.com)
- [Fetch vs Axios - LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/axios-or-fetch-api/)

Both Axios and Fetch get the job done, but depending on your use case, one might be a better fit than the other.
